## Local installation

This project works with **Python 3.12**. Make sure you have this version installed to contribute to development.

To install all required Python packages for development and deployment, run the setup script:

```bash
source ./scripts/setup_dev_environment.sh
```

---

## üå± Environment variables

For local development, you may eventually need to define the following environment variables, depending on the future business logic of the Lambda.  
At this stage, **none are required**.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS

### üì¶ Deployment dependencies (manual deployments)

To manually deploy to AWS, ensure the **AWS CDK** is installed.  
It must match the version specified in the `CDK_VERSION` variable of the `gitlab-ci.yml`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You must manually create the Kin√©is API credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager**, under the ARN defined by `secret_manager_arn` (see `global_config.py`). The secret must include `client_id` and `client_secret` keys corresponding to the Kin√©is API authentication credentials.

### Deployment environments

ATLAS deployment environments are defined in:

aopcs_lambda/target/aws/environments/atlas_environment.py

Each environment has a dedicated configuration file in the same folder.

üëâ See the [ATLAS AWS deployment environments documentation](https://kerlink.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ATLAS/pages/1134460929/Atlas+AWS+deployment+environments) for more details.

---

### Deployment from GitLab

Manual deployments to **preproduction** or **production** can be triggered here:  
üëâ [Launch GitLab pipeline](https://gitlab.klksi.fr/atlas/configuration-app/aopcs-lambda/-/pipelines/new)

Make sure to launch the pipeline from the `develop` branch.

---

### ‚úÖ Pipeline arguments

- `ENVIRONMENT` (**required**): name of the target environment (in uppercase), e.g. `DEVELOPMENT`  
- `VERSION` (optional): Git tag to deploy (defaults to the current commit hash)  
- `CDK_VERSION` (optional): version of the CDK to use (must match `aws-cdk-lib`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not manually set other variables** ‚Äî this may break the pipeline.
